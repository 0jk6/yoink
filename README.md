# Yoink

A small python program that can download raw files from the internet using command line. I would call this as poor man's `wget` lol.

### Why?
Because, I wanted to have something similar to `wget` on my Windows PC, so I wrote this 5 months ago only to find out that there exists a wget port for windows too. But I still use this time to time.

### Usage:
Copy the `yoink.py` file somewhere into the `Local Disk: C` and add it to the `PATH` variable.

you may need to change the `path` in `yoink.py` at `line 11`. Then run the following command


`yoink.py -url -name-of-the-file`
